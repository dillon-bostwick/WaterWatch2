#WaterWatch
##For AT&T NYC Hackathon 4/9/16

A site for prevention of water contamination such as the Flint MI crisis. Users are able to upload information about their water. They are able to see water information that other people in their area have uploaded. The idea is to promote community awareness of issues in light of the Flint crisis in which citizens were not able to get the information they needed.

The site is still live at:
